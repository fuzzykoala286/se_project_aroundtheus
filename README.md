# Project : Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images
- link to github

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**My summary of my project**

while using matrerial i learned through the chapter i was able to create a responsive layout while using grid , flexbox, and responsive design principles that would work differantly depending on the size of the screen. As a summary of my own project i feel i need work in the responsive design area attributed to some of the breaking in my project.
